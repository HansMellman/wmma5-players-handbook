        <p>World of Mixed Martial Arts 5 is a simulation game in which the player, in the guise of an avatar, joins the game world and either watches or takes part in its organic growth. While there is no 'correct' way to play, the primary method of game play centers on the player taking control of an MMA company and guiding them to success (or failure) by taking control of every aspect of the organisation, from scheduling, to match making, to recruitment.</p>

        <p>The utility bar is split into four: quick office, quick characters, quick companies, and user controls. The first of those is the one you'll use most often. It gives you access to your mail and decisions, and also allows quick links to be set up to various office sub-screens. These sub-screens are exactly the same whether you reach them via the office or the quick office utility bar, but the latter means you don't have to navigate to the office each time and so saves you some clicking. You can alter the links via the Edit Layout button. The main play area offers the 'home page' for each section, often allowing you access to sub-screens via buttons. The navigation menu allows you to quickly move to the different main areas of the game and also to advance forward to the next day (either in single days or 'multi-advancing' through many at once). You can hover over an icon if you do not know what it refers to. On most days you will only be using the website and the office screens. When playing the game the interface is divided into three parts: to the left is the navigation menu, to the right is the play area, and at the bottom is the utility bar.</p>

        <p>The player can go from being CEO to being owner as well by applying for the job (via the Business tab from a company's profile). There is no way of going in the reverse direction (i.e. dropping down from being owner to only being CEO). The user's avatar can either be the owner of a company or the CEO (assuming he or she is employed, of course). If the player is the owner he or she is automatically working as the CEO as well. Both roles work in exactly the same way in terms of what the player will be in control of and what his or her responsibilities will be. The only difference is that if the player is only the CEO then he or she has less job security (i.e. failure is more likely to result in the sack) and some actions, particularly in regards to contract offers, can be over-ruled by the owner.</p>

        <summary id="fight-engine-differences">Fight Engine Differences</summary>
        <p>The one and only slight difference is in regards to Quick Fights; as these are individual bouts run from the main menu and therefore are not associated with a specific event, place, or time, anything directly related to any of those things (such as the advantages of a home town crowd, the pressure of main eventing, etc) obviously does not come into play as there is no context with which to use them. It is important to note that there is only one fight engine in WMMA5. Whether the fight is a Quick Fight from the main menu, a fight on a player-controlled event, a fight from an AI-controlled show, or a reality TV bout, and whether the user watches the fight live, reads a report afterward, or just looks at the result, every single fight uses the exact same engine and goes through the full simulation.</p>

        <summary id="how-are-fights-simulated-">How Are Fights Simulated?</summary>
        <p>When it comes to striking, it should be noted that it is always made up of two factors - whether the strike hits, and how well it lands. There is a large degree of randomness in the latter, ensuring that a heavy handed fighter isn't getting a knock out every time he manages to land. In general, striking always has more randomness than grappling or ground work due to the nature of it. When making the calculations, both in terms of what they want to do and what actually happens, the game examines the appropriate skills and adds a degree of randomness. There is some randomness in every single calculation, which is why you will rarely see the exact same fight twice. This means that the fighter with the higher skill levels will always have an advantage, but may not necessarily always get his or her way. In all other cases, there will be an attacking fighter and a defending fighter. The attacker will decide his or her approach from a list of potential options which are contextual; for example, if on top in side control the options may be to pass to mount, to go for a submission, to try and pound away, etc. The defender will then do the same, based on the attacker's choice. The game then calculates what happens in that instant and then the same thing is repeated once again in the next position (or replaying the same position if they haven't moved.) Whenever the two fighters are facing and standing they will decide their 'mindset' (how they want to attack, such as striking or takedowns for example, and how aggressive they want to be about it) and decide an approach for how to proceed. This allows fighters to modify their tactics on the fly. Fights in WMMA5 are done in a modular fashion. There are lots of separate positions (for example, 'standing facing', 'in guard', 'backed up against cage', 'seated against cage with opponent on top', etc) which the fighters will move between as the fight progresses. There are also many overall counters and variables that keep track of how the fight is unfolding that the fighters can reference, for example 'knowing' that they're behind and there's not much time left.</p>

        <summary id="tactics">Tactics</summary>
        <p>The fighters can also take into account context when it comes to deciding strategy. For example, if a fighter has already tried several takedowns without success then he may give up on them entirely on the grounds that it simply isn't working, even if that would normally be his strongest suit. Fighters will always try and go for the most likely route to victory. Usually this will be their own strongest suit, but not always. For example, if two fighters who are primarily strikers meet and they are evenly matched, but one is also a decent wrestler (but not as good as he is at striking) and the other isn't, that fighter may adopt a wrestling based approach as he 'knows' that he has a significant edge in a grappling contest whereas he has no edge at striking. When deciding their 'mindset' or tactics, fighters take into account their own skills and how they relate to their opponents. Their fight IQ (simulated by their Game Plan skill and potentially boosted by their team affiliation) comes into play here as the worse a fighter is at planning, the more he or she will tend to overestimate their own skills and underestimate their opponent's.</p>

        <p>The rules format also has a big impact on the way fights play out. For example, wrestlers tend to like shorter rounds as it becomes easier for them to use 'lay and pray' or 'wall and stall' tactics without the time available for the opponent to mount a comeback. Longer rounds and fights also obviously favour fitter athletes. The environment that a fight takes place in has a direct impact on fights. For example, strikers find it much easier to corner their opponent in a ring than a cage. Also, some fighters are naturally more comfortable in one than the other.</p>

        <p>In all cases, weight-related changes are staggered; that is, the bigger the difference, the bigger the potential bonuses and penalties. The most common changes, however, are those related to weight differences. For example, if one fighter significantly outweighs the other then he or she may get bonuses to strength, punching power, etc, but may well get penalties to skills like footwork in order to simulate the speed difference. A fighter can receive skill boosts and penalties prior to the fight. Some of these will be explicitly commented on, some won't. There are many such changes, ranging from penalties for weight cuts that were too severe, to boosts for fighting in front of a home crowd, to a fighter simply being nervous.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, the worse conditioning a fighter has, the quicker and more obvious the degradation of his or her skills will be. The second mid-fight change is from damage received. For example, body shots will tire a fighter out more quickly than normal. Leg kicks will reduce his or her foot speed as well as affecting stamina levels. A broken rib will affect pretty much everything a fighter can do. There are two primary mid-fight changes. The first is simply due to time and / or physical exertion. The longer the fighter competes and the harder he or she is working, the quicker his or her skills will degrade due to tiredness. A fighter's skills will change during the course of the bout. The player cannot explicitly see this in terms of numbers, but the commentary will reflect it.</p>

        <summary id="rating-fights">Rating Fights</summary>
        <p>The fight rating is important for two main reasons. The first is that it directly impacts an event's Critical Rating. The second is that very exciting or very dull fights can affect the popularity change that a fighter experiences post-fight. It should be noted that the finish, or lack of, is also taken into consideration. For example, a fight that goes to the judges will in effect be punished because it will not be receiving the positive points that an actual finish would have provided. At the end of the fight, the total negative points are removed from the total positive points to reach a final points tally. This value is then used to determine the fight's rating, which is a direct measure of how exciting it was for the fans. Whenever something exciting or interesting happens in a fight (for example, a strike landing, a takedown attempt being launched or completed, a sweep, a successful pass, etc) it is recorded and awarded points based on how much the fans would have enjoyed it. Similarly, whenever something dull or boring happens (for example, a grappling stalemate, 'wall and stall' tactics, a period of inactivity, etc) that is also recorded, but as a negative number of points based on how tedious it was.</p>

        <summary id="judging">Judging</summary>
        <p>It should be noted that the in-game commentator uses the hidden points total when commenting on the action (for example, when he says that he thinks that it was a 10-9 round to fighter #1), and does so without any random numbers or bias being involved. As such, his view is always 100 Judges cannot 'cheat' in the sense of deliberately giving an incorrect result, but the use of random numbers and potential biases do mean that they can make mistakes. The totals that each judge comes up with are then compared to decide who they think won the round and by what score (i.e. 10-9, 10-8, etc). In fights where the judges score the whole contest, this process happens once at the end of the fight rather than after each round. Whenever a fighter achieves something in a fight he or she is given a number of points toward a hidden total. The value is pre-set depending on what happened, so a big takedown may give 10 points while a foot stomp may give just 1, for example. At the end of the round each judge in turn takes the total and applies a random number, based on their personal accuracy and the accuracy specified in the editable fight engine. If that judge has any set biases, this can also alter the figure slightly.</p>

        <p>For example, suppose fighter #1 hits nine trivial punches and one solid punch while fighter #2 hits ten solid punches. Both will show as having hit ten Jabs in the Metrics screen, but clearly fighter #2 will be well ahead with the judges. It is important to note that the judges take into account the impact level, so although level 1 and 3 are both classified as a Jab the latter 'scores' more than the former. Therefore, the Fight Metrics screen should not be taken as an accurate indicator of scoring. The Fight Metrics screen is available at the end of each round and after the fight. It breaks down strikes into Jab and Power categories. In game terms, every strike that lands has its impact rated between 1 and 5, as follows: 1 (trivial), 2 (mild), 3 (solid), 4 (powerful, usually leading to a stun or knock down), 5 (KO). Those rated between 1 and 3 are classified as Jab, 4 and 5 are Power.</p>

The advantage of booking a show more than one month into the future is that it may allow you to get shared fighters booked before a rival uses them. It also allows the fighters longer to hype the fight. The disadvantage is that the longer the fighters are scheduled to fight, the greater the chance that they will sustain an injury during training.

        <summary id="match-making">Match Making</summary>
        <p>Finally, it can be a smart tactic to 'steal' popularity from other fighters. For example, if you have an ageing fighter who has lots of popularity but is clearly declining, it is often a good idea to 'feed' them to rising stars. If the rising star beats them, not only are they likely to rise up the rankings and gain popularity from beating a big name, they'll also gain from the exposure of having been in a much-watched fight. To build new stars, one of the things you will often look at is how to maximise their popularity gains. Putting them in a position to win is clearly the most important part, but allowing them to shine is also important. This can be achieved by cherry-picking their opponent to give them a chance to get impressive finishes, for example, or to avoid problems. For example, if you know you have a devastating striker who is vulnerable to takedowns, putting him or her against a top wrestler would be unwise. With the remainder of the fights, the 'draw' is less important as it has far less impact on the success of the show (particularly the prelims, where the 'draw' is irrelevant). This means that you can use the remainder of the fights to try and build new stars, to groom new talent, and to cycle out old talent. Your approach to match making will generally differ depending on which part of the card you are looking at. With the main and co-main event, you are primarily looking at the 'draw' of the fight - this is how attractive it is to fans. You can see this via the side panels on the match making screen(s). Your goal is to make fights that are going to satisfy the fans, or better still to attract new ones! Match making is at the heart of the game and requires a lot of skill and judgement. The goal is to create a situation where your company has current stars who can headline shows, rising stars who will be able to headline shows in the future, and young talent you can groom for the future.</p>

        <p>On top of that, it is also smart to plan at least one challenger ahead. That is, it generally pays to have title fights and number one contenders fight fairly close to each other, time-wise, as they will then likely be available to be matched up in the future. You would want to avoid a situation where your champion is out of synch with the next contender as you may be forced to endure a long wait until they're both available at the same time. A key part of event planning and match making is not ignoring the future. You will likely need to be running shows fairly regularly and that means you need a constant supply of good main event fights. For this reason, it is smart to 'ration' out your big name stars so that they're not all being used on the same show. It is far better to have four shows each with a big name main event than to overload a single show with many big names!</p>

For example, a main event getting altered due to injury will produce a huge disruption, a prelim fight getting moved will cause little or no disrupion. The following things count as disruptions: fights being cancelled, fights being moved off the show, and fights being altered due to one (or both) of the competitors becoming unavailable. Adding new fights or filling in To Be Announced positions do not count as disruptions. In the week immediately before a scheduled event takes place it is considered vulnerable to change. During this time period, changes may be logged as official 'Event Disruptions'. The more disruptions that happen, the more the Commercial Rating will be impacted.

        <p>To get higher commercial ratings the player would need simply to provide bigger drawing fights. The higher the final rating is, the more fans will have been enticed to watch it (whether live or on TV). It should be noted that the final rating that you see when viewing an event is the 'draw' in the area that it was held only (although is almost all cases this will also be the highest rating of any of the game areas). It is calculated primarily by looking at the 'draw' of the main event and co-main event, with the main event being by far the more important of the two (if the co-main event is a bigger draw than the main event, they are essentially swapped over for the purposes of the calculation). If either of the main two fights was part of a one night tournament then their rating is instead calculated as the best 'draw' of the tournament as a whole. A strong main show undercard can give a mild boost to the final rating, while the preliminary fights have no impact at all.

Fighters can 'remember' offers, and will never be happy if an offer is made worse; their 'memory' lasts for several days.

The offer will automatically filled in with appropriate values for a fighter of that level. However, some fighters have excessive demands due to their personalities or other circumstances and may require more. You can see a visual representation of their take on the offer via the icons that appear at the side of the offer screen once you've made the offer official. Negotiations can be started with any character simply by hitting the Negotiations button on any of the many roster or profile screens on which it appears. If the fighter has absolutely no desire to join you (or can't) then you will always be informed immediately, before the negotiation screen appears; this saves the user from wasting time on offers that can't possibly succeed.</p>

        <p>Fighters who have been 'quick hired' do not suffer any sort of direct penalty in their fight. However, as their camp will have been very short they will be at a disadvantage because they will not have gained as much skill as they normally would with a full camp. If you make this sort of offer then the fighter will always respond quickly and be willing to fight at short notice if booked within seven days of signing. The drawback is that they'll expect slightly more money than usual. When negotiating, the user can specifically request a 'quick hire' by selecting the 'and I need a quick response' option. This lets the fighter know that you want a speedy response and that you're intending for them to fight at short notice. This is designed to allow users to fill spots on a card that has been hit with injuries.</p>

        <p>It should be noted that if the fighter has a non-exclusive deal that isn't near to expiry then he will automatically assign that a value and potentially consider rejecting other offers in favour of sticking with what he already has. When deciding between multiple offers, the fighter will go for the one which has been evaluated to have the highest value rating. This calculation is heavily influenced by a fighter's Career Goals setting. For example, someone who is motivated by Glory will tend to place more value on working for a larger company as it means more exposure. When evaluating contract offers a fighter will create a value rating. This is based primarily on how much he or she can realistically expect to make over the course of the contract, while taking into account the size of the company and the security it offers.</p>

For example, if a fighter is on $1000 base pay and has a win bonus of 50 The performance scale refers to the change that the base pay will undergo with a victory. For example, '+5 The base pay is the most important term and is how much the fighter makes for appearing for that company, irrespective of result.

These are: if they have been caught in a scandal or legal issues, if they are serving a drug suspension (even if the failed drug test was in another organisation), if they failed a drug test in your organisation in the past month, and if their contract allows them to be cut for free following a loss. The cost of cutting a character is the number of guaranteed fights he or she has left multiplied by the base pay. If a fighter has no guaranteed fights left, they can be cut for free. The end result is exactly the same regardless of which method you choose, there are multiple ways to achieve it simply because it makes the user's life easier to be able to do it from so many different places. In particular, users may find that the Cut From Roster section is very useful immediately after running a show because of its in-built filters. There are three ways to cut / fire a character from your organisation. You can click on their contract details text in the Roster or Child Organisation screens, access the Employment part of their profile, or use the Cut From Roster section of the office.</p>

        <p>There is no real advantage or disadvantage to having interim champions, they exist primarily to help keep divisions active. The game automatically takes into account that an interim title is less valuable in marketing terms than the real champion. Interim champions, as in reality, are 'back-up' holders of a title who exist when the champion is likely to be unable to defend for a significant amount of time. To create an interim champion the player simply has to book a title fight between two fighters who aren't the champion - the resulting fight will automatically be an interim title fight (unless the title is vacated before that fight happens).</p>

The title's prestige will always move to reflect the champion, using the hidden ranking value, although it can only rise of fall by a relatively small amount each time. For example, a champion who is high up the pound-for-pound rankings will see any title he or she holds naturally rise in prestige. A title's prestige is an indication of how respected it is in regards to who has been holding it. It is updated after every title bout, but is not affected by interim title fights.</p>

This allows, for example, a highly ranked Lightweight to fight for the Welterweight title without getting penalised (assuming his Lightweight ranking is sufficiently high). A company will get penalised for using weak champions and challengers in title fights. A fighter is considered weak if his ranking points (after being modified to take into account his current momentum) are low compared to the others in the top five of that division.</p>

        <p>The power of the scaling increases for every 10lbs of weight difference. If there is less than 10lbs of difference, no scaling happens at all. The game automatically scales the fighters' skills at the start of a fight based on their respective weights (NB: the game is using their actual weights at the time of the fight, not what they weighed in at). For example, a fighter who is a lot lighter will see his striking power, grappling ability, etc, diminish, but will also see his opponent's hand speed, mobility, etc, go down too. It is important to note that a fighter's skill levels are relative to his current size and do not need to be scaled. For example, a Flyweight with 100 Punch Power does not hit as hard as a Heavyweight with 100 Punch Power.</p>

        <p>The potential gains from training depend on lots of factors, including the fighter's dedication, age (or more accurately, position in their career cycle), natural skill levels, and the team (if any) that he or she is associated with. A lazy fighter with no team is going to gain at a far slower rate than a motivated individual with a top team. It should be noted that active training only happens for the 4-6 weeks immediately before a fight. If the fighter is booked much further in advance than that, the early training would be considered passive as he or she does not want to peak too early. This stops players from 'super charging' their fighters by booking everyone months in advance! An active fighter is constantly training, but it is divided into active and passive. Active training occurs when they have a fight scheduled, inactive training is when they don't. The difference is that active training is far more intense and so the gains are greater. This is why fighters who compete a lot will get better faster than those who don't.</p>

Primarily this skill is used when the two fighters are at close quarters, whether that be in a clinch, scrambling or having ended up close together for some other reason. Usually this will be a straight battle comparing the Grappling skill of both fighters to see who comes out on top. It is also used when a fighter wants to close the distance and start grappling; for example, it may be compared to the opponent's hand speed and reach (amongst other skills) to measure whether he can initiate a clinch and how many strikes he'll take getting there.

This is done by comparing the team's Mental Training Strength to the fighter's Game Plan; if the team would be better at producing a game plan than the fighter then they take over, essentially artificially boosting the fighter's Game Plan value for the duration of the fight. This is how good the fighter is at game planning. When the fighter is deciding his current strategy in a fight (which occurs multiple times per round), his Game Plan value affects how he rates both himself and his opponent. A low value, for example, means he is more likely to overestimate his own skills and underestimate his opponent's. This could lead to him adopting a bad strategy. On the flip side, a fighter with a high Game Plan value is going to be much more accurate in his assessment and therefore his strategy will likely be better tailored for him.</p>

Unless set otherwise via the Era section of the editor, the game will fill up areas where there is not enough talent (for the default classes, the minimum is 25 men and 15 women) with new fighters. For example, if there is a company in Europe with a male Lightweight division but hardly any male lightweight fighters available, the game will intentionally create a selection of appropriate fighters. This may result in a sudden glut of debuting fighters. New fighters will appear during gameplay. These can take the form of preset characters that have been added to the game via the editor, or brand new characters who are freshly formed on the fly.</p>

        <p>Under normal circumstances, employed fighters will not retire during the first six months of a game. This is to help balance the database by stopping early mass retirements. Female fighters tend to have a natural retirement age that is 3-5 years younger than their male counterparts. The criteria that govern when a fighter retires include his age (in relation to his life cycle), his current employment, and his current success levels. For example, a fighter may have a 'natural' retirement age of 38 but add another 3 years to that because he is currently making huge amounts of money with a major company and another 2 years because he is currently a world ranked fighter on a winning streak. On the flip side, a fighter who can't find a job and has lost his last three fights may check out early. There are two types of retirement during the game, retirement from active competition and retirement from the game world itself. The latter is permanent and applies to non-fighters as well.</p>

        <p>A child company is a financial extension of the parent. As such, at the end of each month all the child company's funds are absorbed. This means that if they made a loss, the parent covers it, and any profit it also taken by the company. For this reason, a child company cannot go bankrupt as long as the parent company is running. Having a child company allows you to call up or send fighters down whenever you want, in essence giving you an AI-run place to either build up new talent or revitalise old talent. You can edit much of the running of the child company via the Child Organisation button in your office. You cannot actually book their shows or do match-making, however. A child company is one owned by a larger company. To get a child company you would need to takeover another company (see Takeovers, below).</p>

If the counter reaches a certain limit, the company closes. The limit is calculated with regard to the company's current size and how long they have been active - a large, historic company will therefore take quite a long time to go out of business. The amount of debt does not impact the length of the limit, and so the player cannot quicken a company's demise by setting them to be in extreme debt. Companies will generally only close for one of two reasons; bankruptcy or being bought out by another company.</p>

This is because bankruptcy, as discussed in the previous topic, is time-sensitive (i.e. the company must be in debt for an extended period of time). Companies will never accept a takeover if they have money left, are bigger than the predator company, or are still several months away from bankruptcy. You can attempt to takeover a company via the Business button in their profile. Successfully taking over a company means you pay off their debts and they turn into your 'child' company.</p>

        <p>The team's reputation is important as it indicates to other fighters how successful the team is and what quality it has within it. Therefore, it has a big effect on which fighters will want to come and train there. A team's reputation is calculated once per month (the exact day is dependent on the team's hidden destiny value). A target value is created by calculating the average of the three highest reputation's of fighters currently affiliated with the team (penalties apply if there are less than three fighters present). If the team's reputation is below this target value then it will slowly start to move toward it, and likewise it will creep downward if the value is lower than it's current reputation.</p>

So having a world class wrestler join does not mean that the team becomes better at wrestling training. It does not matter whether a fighter is a Permanent Member, Long Term Member or Visitor when training happens, the potential boosts from being on a team are the same. Being on a team can help a fighter's rate of improvement during training because the team's strengths give extra boosts to certain skills. For example, being on a team with strong Jiu-Jitsu will lead to a fighter improving his passing, submission skills, etc.</p>

        <p>On top of this, there is also another hidden counter that gives an overall duration that they can stay. If this expires, the fighter will choose to leave. Very few fighters will reach this expiry date, it is included to stop fighters with long term injuries or absences from taking up a spot on the team when they aren't actually doing anything. Once a fighter has completed his minimum amount, any losses he suffers from that point on will cause him to choose to leave the team shortly after. Once a fighter has completed his maximum then he will also choose to leave. This system ensures that a fighter's form plays a large part in how long he sticks around for. When a fighter joins a team, unless they're a permanent member, they are given a hidden counter for the minimum and maximum number of fights they will stay for. Visitors will have small amounts, Long Term members have larger.</p>

        <p>Fights on local cards and preliminary bouts always get reduced effects. Fast, decisive wins always result in the biggest gains and can result in bonus gains if the fighter is particularly marketable. 'Being successful in fights' covers several things. The most important is winning (or drawing against a better or equal opponent), with the better the opponent, the bigger the gain. The method of victory, how quickly the victory was achieved, their performance in any post-fight interview, and their work in building up the fight can also result in gains. Fighters with high momentum gain popularity faster than normal while negative momentum severely slows the rate of gain. Fighters can gain popularity from external incidents, but the primary method of adding popularity comes from three things: appearing on events (the bigger the company, the bigger the gain), being successful in fights, and from having exciting fights.</p>

There is no limit to how many fighters can be hyped at any one time, but in general it should be reserved for fighters who the user feels are going to justify it. Whether a fighter lives up to the hype or not depends on the context. For example, if the fighter has massive amounts of hype then winning alone may not be enough to live up to the hype, he or she must win in style or with a dominant performance. The more hype there is, the harder it is to meet expectations but the more potential gains there are. The advantage of using this is that if a fighter lives up to the hype then they'll gain popularity faster than normal as fans 'buy into' them. The disadvantage is that any failures on their part will be magnified due to the scrutiny they're under and so any popularity losses will be increased. Hyping a fighter means that the company will make a special effort to present them as a big deal; the announcers will push their accomplishments, video packages will highlight their skills, they'll be featured prominently on advertising and merchandise, etc. The user can hype fighters via the Hype screen (also available via the roster).</p>

Once this countdown expires, the region will change. Unregulated regions always become Regulated, whereas Illegal regions can jump to either depending on how conservative they are. There are two elements at play in the evolution of each region. The first is a hidden counter that gradually increases on a month by month basis; when it is 'full' then the region's authorities will start the process of changing their stance.

        <p>There is no way to directly see whether a fighter is taking drugs other than via test failures. A fighter does not necessarily take drugs throughout his career; he may start midway through and may also stop at any time. Whether he starts will be dependent on how his career is going, his age, and his attributes. Whether he goes clean is dependent on the same information, but also on how his employer is handling drug fails and whether he has been caught or not. A fighter's potential drug usage (drug usage in this context being drugs, PEDs, or TRT) is calculated by looking at his Drugs attributes and the current era settings (if no era is defined, the level defaults to 10</p>

        <summary id="hiding-drug-use">Hiding Drug Use</summary>
        <p>With regards to their destiny value, this is simply a case that some fighters are destined to be better at hiding their drug usage than others. This does not change over the course of their career. With regards to age, the older a fighter gets the harder it becomes for him to mask his drug use. For this reason, you are more likely to see fighters fail tests later in their career (particularly as they are more likely to have begun using TRT in order to stay competitive). All fighters have the ability to hide (or 'mask') their use of drugs. The probability of them successfully doing so is based on their age, hidden destiny value, and attributes.</p>

        <p>If a fighter fails a drugs test you will be informed by e-mail (assuming your mail settings allow it) and it may also appear on the in-game website. The type of failure will also be shown in the fight recap information. The test is done in two stages. Firstly, it is decided whether the fighter successfully masked or hid his usage (see Hiding Drug Use, above). Only if he was unsuccessful at doing so is the second stage run. In this stage, the chance of being caught is dependent on the settings of the agency, region, or company that is doing the testing. The chance is a literal percentage, so a 50 If a fighter is drug tested, it is automatically for all three possible types of cheating; (recreational) drugs, PEDs, and TRT. Each is tested separately.</p>

        <p>Fighters are aware of how strictly each company handles drug failures and take this into account. For example, a company that fires a high percentage of fighters who fail tests will gain a reputation for being anti-drugs and fighters in that organisation will be far more likely to get clean rather than risk failing a drug test and getting fired. Similarly, a company that takes little or no action against fighters who fail tests will see their fighters far less likely to fight clean in the future. If a fighter fails a drugs test then the company that ran the event can cut his contract for free up to a month after the failure. If the fighter was also officially suspended then any company that employs him can cut him for free for the duration of the suspension.</p>

        <p>When a fight's original result gets changed due to a drug test failure, the fighters' win-loss records get adjusted to take into account the change and the person who failed will lose any positive momentum that they hold. However, it is important to note that the fighters still 'remember' the original result and it can psychologically affect their decisions. For example, a fighter who won originally but had the decision reversed may still consider himself the real winner and treat it as a victory in some circumstances (such as when considering a rematch). Whether the original or changed result is being considered changes depending on context, but the official result will always be the one displayed to the player.</p>

        <p>Showcases are a special type of large local show. They happen once a year at most and feature only the very best unsigned talent taken from around the world. Even major stars can work these events. It is a good way for fighters to increase their profile and fight top-level competition that they otherwise would not be able to meet. Small and Large local shows will regularly happen in every area that has enough unemployed fighters to warrant it. They happen automatically and are unaffected by anything the user does. Large local shows primarily feature unemployed fighters taking each other on, with occasional local fighters thrown in to make up the number if necessary. This provides a sterner test and can allow fighters to generate a buzz or resurrect their careers. Major stars will not work these events even if they are unemployed for a long time. Small local shows are for inexperienced fighters and allow them to build their skills and win-loss record against poor quality local fighters. Once a fighter has proven themselves, they will no longer work these events. Local shows are events that are not associated with a particular company. They simulate the local-level MMA scene and allow unemployed fighters to develop their skills, stay active, and to try and attract job offers. They are divided by game area, except that Central America and Russia are combined with South America and Europe respectively due to their lack of talent depth. These shows come in three sizes, Small, Large, and Showcase.</p>

        <p>A fighter who fails to make weight is ineligible for any reputation gain, but will take any reputation losses. If the fighter is competing in a class in which they have no current reputation, they do not necessarily start from nothing. If they have reputation in the weight class immediately above (i.e heavier) then this is used to create a base level. If no reputation is found, the weight class immediately below is checked. Only if no reputation is found in either does the fighter start from scratch. A fighter's reputation gets adjusted when he fights. If the weight class they fight in does not match one of the eleven official weight classes, the maximum weight limit is used to decide which class is affected (i.e. if they fight in a division that is 150-160lbs, it would affect their Welterweight reputation). Openweight fights do not affect any reputation class. Every fighter has eleven reputation values, one for each of the official weight classes (Atomweight to Super Heavyweight). These are not directly visible in the game. These show how highly he or she is rated in that weight class and are the main data used in creating rankings.</p>

        <summary id="changing-reputation">Changing Reputation</summary>
        <p>The quality and excitement of a fight has no impact on rankings, which are purely based on competitive achievements. In certain situations, gains are severely limited or unavailable. For example, there are no points for beating local fighters once a competitor has reached a certain level, and there is a cap on how high wins on local shows can take a fighter. The amount can be further adjusted by the fighter's current momentum and they can receive a sizeable boost if they are on a lengthy undefeated streak. The amount that a fighter's reputation changes depends on three primary factors: the result of the fight, the comparative reputation of the opponent, and the method and decisiveness of the finish. The biggest possible gain would therefore be to score a decisive win (for example, a quick knock out) over someone with a much higher reputation. Only just managing to beat someone who you were expected to crush would give few, if any, points. Forfeited fights do not affect reputation.</p>

        <p>Permanent expiry happens if the fighter spends eight or more fights competing outside of a weight class. In this case, his rating in that class returns to being 'unknown'. If he then comes back to that weight class then the rating is recalculated afresh. This prevents a fighter from being judged on a rating that is extremely out of date. If a fighter competes outside of a weight class three times in a row then his rating in that weight class becomes temporarily expired: this means that it no longer counts towards any ranking. If the fighter then comes back to that weight class then it becomes active again. There are two ways that a fighter's reputation in a weight class can expire: temporary and permanent.</p>

        <summary id="reputation-change-examples">Reputation Change Examples</summary>
        <p>It is to be remembered that these are the base values only; they can be modified slightly with regard to the fighter's current situation. For example, being on a winning streak can give up to a 10 For a 'competitive bout' (that is, one in which the fighters were very close in reputation) the values are 75, 60, 35, -75, -60, -35. For a bout where the winner had a much higher reputation the values are 35, 15, 8, -15, -10, -4. If the winner was only a slight favourite the values would be 60, 35, 20, -60, -35, -20. A bout where the winner was a relative (but not huge) underdog would have 80, 65, 40, -85, -75, -40. A huge underdog winning would see values of 120, 100, 75, -125, -110, -90. A win over a 'local' fighter would give 30, 12, 5. If one or both fighters have no reputation value to base these calculations on then special context-specific code is used, but the winner can expect to be getting 30-70 points and the loser will be getting somewhere between 0-15 (unless the other person already has a high reputation in which case they are eligible for massive boosts). In each case you will see six values; these correspond to what the winner can expect to gain from a clean finish, a decisive decision, and a disputed or controversial result respectively, and then the same values for the loser of the bout. The following are examples of the values that are used within the game engine for changing fighters' reputations. For most players this information will not be particularly relevant as it is not directly visible within the game, however, it is provided here primarily so that database makers can get a feel for what numbers to use when filling in data. As shown in the editor, the overall range of reputation is from 0 to 1000.</p>

For this reason, it's possible for a title holder to be above someone in a weight class ranking but below them in the Pound For Pound list. World rankings are updated automatically 2 days after every National or International event (the counter is reset if another major show happens before it expires) or after 28 days of inactivity. Some bonus points are given if the fighter holds a title in a National or International company. For very highly ranked fighters, their momentum can slightly increase or decrease the total (this is used to stop 'bottle necks'). World rankings for each of the eleven weight classes are created by looking at each fighter's reputation in that class. A fighter must have fought at least 5 times (across all weights) to qualify and at least one of his last three fights (excluding tournaments and openweight fights) must have been as part of the weight class in question.</p>

Company rankings work in a very similar manner to the world rankings, although there is no 5 fight minimum requirement. If the company's weight class spans more than one of the eleven official weight classes, the best score is used.

        <summary id="relative-rankings">Relative Rankings</summary>
        <p>In conclusion, big rises and falls in the division can be expected in newer divisions, or in divisions where the top handful of fighters have very similar 'scores', because of the relative nature of the rankings. To further illustrate this, you can imagine a fictional division where nobody has ever fought before. If everyone fights once, the top 25 is likely to be made up entirely of people with a 1-0 record, with #1 probably being the person who was slightly more impressive. Because the rankings are relative, it would not be unusual to see the #1 person fall entirely off the rankings if he lost his second fight, as clearly if there were 25 people who went 2-0 then they would have more points than him. For example, in a very new division such as the Female Flyweight division in the game's default data where most of the fighters have less than ten fights, the number of ranking points that the #1 fighter has is not going to be massively higher than the person at #25 because they simply haven't fought enough to 'score' very highly. The rankings will therefore be very volatile, with people rising or falling many places after a single fight, because the amount of points they can gain or lose per fight are going to be proportionally quite high compared to the overall totals. By contrast, a well established division would be less volatile because the spread of points are likely to be far greater, meaning wins and losses will have proportionally less impact. If is extremely important to remember that all rankings within the game only make sense in relation to the other people in that class, and as such the amount of places that a fighter can rise or fall in one go is only limited by how everybody else is doing.</p>

The purpose of the destiny value is to add an element of randomness so that every game is different, even when played with otherwise identical data. Characters, companies, and teams all have a hidden 'destiny' value.

        <p>As a rule of thumb, technique declines at a slower pace than explosiveness, mobility, and general physical ability. The rate at which a fighter's skill naturally decline depends on the skill in question and their physical health. For example, a fighter's natural strength and punching power decline very slowly indeed, whereas footwork and conditioning go down very rapidly. On top of that, if the fighter has sustained many injuries to a specific body part then that can also have an effect. For example, a fighter who has battered legs is going to lose his mobility at an extremely quickened pace. During this part of the cycle, two things happen. Firstly, their ability to improve their skills is hugely slowed, meaning that a declining fighter is unlikely to get much better than he currently is (although high-level and very focused training can overcome this, at least temporarily). Secondly, their skills start to naturally decline. A fighter is in the 'declining' part of their career when their age is equal to or greater than their Decline Age.</p>

To qualify for one of the fighter awards, a competitor must have fought at least twice during that calendar year. There is a slight bias towards people who have fought more. The awards are based on the impressiveness of victories a fighter has achieved; for example, the world #1 beating the world #2 would get quite a lot of points, but the world #10 beating the world #2 would gain more as it's a more impressive feat for him or her to have made. The End Of Year Awards are handed out on the final day of each year. They simulate the in-game website giving out accolades.

        <summary id="the-two-editors">The Two Editors</summary>
        <p>The secondary editor, usually known as the 'in-game' editor, is available from the Options menu while playing a save game. This is less powerful, but allows you to alter the data that is currently in use. This is generally recommended only for fixing mistakes and 'cheating', not for making wide-ranging changes. Whatever changes are made here only impact the save game in question. The main editor (also sometimes called the 'primary' editor) is available via the main title screen. This is by far the more powerful of the two and allows you to create, edit, and delete to your heart's content. However, whatever you do in here only affects save games started from that point onwards. Existing save games are not impacted. WMMA5 comes with two editors and it is important to know the difference.</p>

        <summary id="what-are-mods-">What Are Mods?</summary>
        <p>You can create your own mods by using the main editor to create a brand new database and passing it on to people. You will find your database in WMMA5 -> Databases -> DatabaseName. It is a single file, WMMA5.mdb, that is all you need to distribute to pass on the data. 'Mods' are fan-made databases that you can install in order to play in alternate game worlds. The majority of these you will find in the Mods subforum on the Grey Dog Software boards. Often they will come with custom graphics.</p>

        <summary id="installing-a-mod">Installing A Mod</summary>
        <p>Installing mods is extremely easy, all you need is to have downloaded the appropriate mod and to have access to a zipping program (like WinZip or WinRar, both of which are freely available and usually come pre-installed on machines. If you access the main editor there is a button in the information bar at the bottom called Install Mod; simply click this and follow the instructions given.</p>

        <summary id="playing-a-multiplayer-game">Playing A Multiplayer Game</summary>
        <p>If you wish to play multiplayer remotely then you will need to send the save game to the next player each turn. You can find the save game in WMMA5 -> Databases -> DatabaseName -> SaveGames -> SaveGameName. You should zip that folder up and send it to the next player, who adds (or replaces) it to the same place on his machine. WMMA5's multiplayer mode is designed to be played 'hot seat', that is, with all the players in the same room.</p>

        <summary id="versions-and-patches">Versions And Patches</summary>
        <p>You can find what version you are currently using by looking at the taskbar on the opening screen. It will be in the format '1.00'. The game will alert you when a new patch is available via a pop-up message when you first load it (assuming the game can access the Internet at the time). You are strongly advised to keep up to date as much as you can because patches can rarely fix things that have already gone wrong, only prevent them from happening in the first place; therefore not patching until after you get hit with an error is generally not going to help you. Patches fix errors and add new content. They can be found in the WMMA5 Technical Support forum, where you will also find simple installation instructions. WMMA5 is regularly updated via the use of patches. A patch is a new EXE file that simply replaces your existing copy.</p>

        <summary id="accessing-save-games">Accessing Save Games</summary>
        <p>WMMA5 databases and save games use Microsoft Access Databases and are MDB files. They are password protected because users should not manipulate them directly. This is because the databases themselves have no error-checking (it is entirely in-game) and so if the user adds any incorrect data then the database or save game can be rendered unplayable. Please note that no technical support is offered for MDB files that have been messed up this way.</p>

        <summary id="licenses">Licenses</summary>
        <p>Please note that you should never give your license code to anyone else, as doing so could allow it to be stolen. For information on moving licenses, or how to deal with any license issues that may arise, please see the WMMA5 Technical Support forum. Purchasing WMMA5 gives the buyer one license, which will usually take the form of a long string of characters and numbers begining with 'VT-'. You can find this in your purchase receipt e-mail and it should be kept safe. This allows you to play the game on one computer at a time. You may move the license back and forth between multiple machines as often as you like as long as it is only active in one place at any one time.</p>
